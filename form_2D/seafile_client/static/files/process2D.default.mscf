# the highest compress_level, the better the compression, but expect some distortions and missing small peaks
compress_level = 3.0

# the process creates an intermediate file.
# If interfile is given, it will be created and used - and it will remain after processing
# interfile = /DATA/FT-ICR/bradykinine/bradikynine_2D_inter.msh5

# if freq_f1demodu is defined, it will be used by do_f1demodu

# do_modulus : if True, a modulus will be applied at the end of the processing

# a noise removal algorithm can be used during processing to remove the scintillation noise 
# two algorithms are available in the program: SANE and URQRD.
# both are applied on each column of the 2D before Fourier transform,
# they require a rank parameter which is an estimate of the mean number of lines present in each column
# not very stringent, if unkown, choose a small value (10) for rather "empty" 2D,
# and a large one (50-200) for a "full" one. experiment !
# both can be iterated, which will improve the quality, in particular in very noisy situations.
# for both algo, processing time is proportional to rank x iteration x size in F1

# URQRD is the original algorithm,
#   Efficient denoising algorithms for large experimental datasets and their applications in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry

# SANE is more efficient in extracting small peaks from the noise, and has a better peak height fidelity.

# PG_SANE iterations are required to obtain convergence, usually the more the better (and the slower)

# The program is fully parallel and can use 2 systems to go multi-processor

#    MPI is preferable, and is chosen when launching the program
#    multiprocessing on the other hand is chosen from the configuration file:
# mp is set to True to start the multiprocessing mode
mp = False
# nproc is the number of process on which the computation is done ( +1 for control)
# so the optimum is n+1 = nb of core on the machine.
